# VpadTextEditor

A Tkinter-based text editor with formatting, themes, file operations, and **Agent Assist** tools.

## New Agentic Feature: Agent Assist

Use **Agent → Open Agent Assist** (or `Ctrl+Shift+A`) to open a helper panel that can run local text intelligence actions on selected text (or the full document):

- Summarize
- Extract Action Items
- Improve Clarity
- Convert to Bullet Points

Then click **Apply to Editor** to replace selected text or append the result.
